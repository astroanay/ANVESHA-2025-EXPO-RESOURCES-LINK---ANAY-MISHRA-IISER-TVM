## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Organize and preserve **all materials** used in the ANVESHA 2025 EXPO project.  
- Provide a **single reference point** for revisiting or expanding the research.  
- Enable **reuse and collaboration** for future astrophysics exhibitions or studies.  
- Support outreach by presenting **complex astrophysical phenomena visually**.

---

## 🧠 Scientific Focus

The project investigates:
- How **stellar jets** are formed from accretion disks around young stars.  
- The **morphological diversity** of jets (shocks, knots, and magnetic structures).  
- The **observable signatures** in regions like the Carina Nebula.  
- The importance of jet studies in understanding **star formation and feedback**.

## 🧩 How to Use

1. **Explore PDFs** for theoretical and background knowledge.
2. **Run the simulation** (`JET_Simulation.ipynb`) using:

   * Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab / Google Colab / VS Code
3. **Use the GIFs and animations** for time lapses and visualizing stellar jets.
4. **Refer to `question and references.pdf`** for guided exploration and citations.

---

## 🚀 Future Directions

* Extend simulations with **magnetic field modeling** or **radiative effects**.
* Integrate **interactive visualization tools** (e.g., Plotly or PyVista).
* Develop **poster or slide templates** for reuse in outreach programs.
* Curate more **observational datasets** from HST or JWST archives.
